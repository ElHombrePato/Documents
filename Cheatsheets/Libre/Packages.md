# Introduction

The aim of this simple "guide" is to present most of the (best) software I have found that works on Linux, though most of them also run on other platforms, oh, and they are all FSF approved (open source if you don't know what FSF is). Try the software and give it a spin to see if it suites your needs. Also, here goes a disclaimer, I am by no means an expert in most of the software listed below, however, the time I have used has proven to be more than pleasant and productive; the only requirement I ask from the program in question is for it to be great for power users.

Also note that some programs may fit several categories listed below. I will list it were I feel it suites best.

## Linux/BSD/Illumos distributions

### Stability wise

These distributions are mostly based on the premise of delivering a stable experience. However, this does not mean you are bounded to use only _stable_ software. Some distributions allow you to use newer software, such as Alpine (community repo), OpenSUSE (Tumbleweed), MX Linux (debian backports and testing), NetBSD (current branch), FreeBSD (current branch).

* [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/):

## Terminal applications

No "low level" utilities will be listed below, just the programs that you will find yourself dealing directly, this means no mention to tar, grep, awk, sed, cups, gvfs, ntfs-3g, etc. However, they are all wonderful programs.

### Shell

* [Mksh](https://www.mirbsd.org/mksh.htm): it is one of the fastest, smallest yet featureful shells available. It runs pretty much anywhere. It is the default shell in Android.

### Helpers

* [Abduco](https://github.com/martanne/abduco) and [dvtm](https://github.com/martanne/dvtm): created by the same person, [Marc Andr√® Tanner](https://github.com/martanne). Abduco provides session management within the terminal. Dvtm is a terminal multiplexer. Combined, they provide the same functionality as [GNU Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) or [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) while being simpler (though not as flexible or customizable). GNU Screen or Tmux are also very nice multiplexers, and you are encouraged to try them.

### System tools

* [Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch): prints system information directly to the terminal with a nice logo. Use [Inxi](https://github.com/smxi/inxi) if you would like a richer output.

* [Lm_sensors](https://github.com/groeck/lm-sensors): monitor temperatures, control fans, etc.

* [Bluez](http://www.bluez.org/): bluetooth management. If a graphical user interface is being used, then [Blueman](https://github.com/blueman-project/blueman) will be of great help.

* [Htop](http://hisham.hm/htop/): a wonderful task manager, use it.

* [Udisks](https://github.com/storaged-project/udisks): mount and unmount drives or volumes with no difficulties.

* [Ranger](https://ranger.github.io/): complete file manager in the terminal, even with fancy preview, columns, etc; and it is fully customizable! Another file manager would be [Midnight Commander (mc)](https://midnight-commander.org/). If a much lighter alternative is wanted [nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nnn#file-handling) is also wonderful. There is [ncdu](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu) too, which is a disk usage analizer.

* [Rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/): an outstanding file transfer utility. It is mainly targeted towards incremental transfers. It is mainly used for backup or complex copying.

* [Borg](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg): as it says in it's description: Deduplicating archiver with compression and authenticated encryption. It works wonders for backups.

* [Atool](http://www.nongnu.org/atool/): a multi-format archiver and extractor.

#### Power management

* [TLP](https://linrunner.de/en/tlp/tlp.html): The Linux Power manager. If you have a laptop, make sure to install it and configure it properly if needed.

* [Powertop](https://01.org/powertop/): power monitoring with togglable options to further tweak your power consumption.

### Networking

* [Curl](https://curl.haxx.se/): the Swiss knife tool to transfer data with URLs.

* [Rtorrent](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent): powerful torrent management utility. I recommend using [Pyroscope's extended distribution](https://github.com/pyroscope/rtorrent-ps). If a GUI is needed then [Qbittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) or [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) are available with optional terminal backends.

* [WeeChat](https://weechat.org/): extensible and powerful IRC client. There are extensions to expand its compatibility with other protocols.

* [Nmap](https://nmap.org/): the Swiss knife tool to analyze networks.

* **General tools:** [Crucible](https://github.com/GaloisInc/crucible): library for symbolic simulation of imperative programs. [SAW-Script](https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-script): scripting language for SAW (Software Analysis Workbench).

#### Web

* [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/): make yourself a favour and use it instead of JavaScript. There is also [PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/) if you prefer the Haskell way.

* **Transpilers to JavaScript:** [Rust Yew](https://github.com/DenisKolodin/yew), the goodness of Rust in all of its glory (targets WASM). [Go GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs): compiler form Go to JavaScript. [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/): modern language to create reliable webapps.

* [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/): there are quite a few frameworks out there, but Phoenix, written in Elixir, is definitely the best one out there; and it allows you to use Node.js seamlessly.

* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/): system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

* **Static Builders:** [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/): great(est) static pages generator, Go based. [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/): an alternative based on Haskell. [Gutenberg](https://www.getgutenberg.io/): same, but with Rust.

* **Extra bits, none Open Source** [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com/): as its name implies, simple, yet complete domain acquisition service with Let's Encrypt certificates; and they fully support open source. [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/): complete hosting solution, not the cheapest, but one of the easiest and complete ones. [UpCloud](https://www.upcloud.com/): another nice hosting solution.

### Databases

* [Sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html): a lightweight SQL solution.

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): extremely powerful, and a tad complex ORDBMS.

* [Redis](https://redis.io/): in-memory storage.

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): a powerful and flexible NoSQL database.

### Networks - Social Media

* [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-US/): self-hosted Git. Similar to Github; and much lighter than [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), which is a more complete solution, and it is used by major companies and projects.

* **Project management:** [Tuleap](https://www.tuleap.org/), complete software solution for any project. [Phabricator](https://phacility.com/) is a _down to the code_ alternative.

* [LibrePay](https://liberapay.com/): similar to Patreon. One can donate to individuals, projects, companies or be given money for ones work.

* [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/): twitter like network, but decentralized and several times better (btw, you don't _tweet,_ you **toot**). Mastodon is based on [GNU Social](https://gnu.io/social/), which is also great, and it is compatible with it. Another alternative compatible with the OStatus systems (*Gnu Social and Mastodon*) is [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social), which is written in Elixir.

* [GNU FM (Libre FM)](https://gnu.io/fm/): relative of GNU Social, but directed for music streaming.

* [Wire](https://wire.com/en/): a _collaboration_ network, similar to Slack or Telegram, but much better. There is also [Mattermost](https://www.mattermost.org/), which is a lot more _enterprisesy,_ so up to you.

* [Matrix](https://matrix.org/blog/home/): _An open network for secure, decentralized communication._ As clients I would recommend [Nheko](https://github.com/mujx/nheko) for pc, and [Riot](https://about.riot.im/) for the mobile. If the CLI is your thing, there is an extension for WeeChat.

* **Not OpenSource:** [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/): professional video streaming/uploading.
